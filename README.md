# Groq AI Chat Bot API (Backend)

This is the backend API for my porforlio chat bot. The idea was conceptualized by Wunna Aung and implemented by Linn Myat Maung. Unlike the original implementation using Azure OpenAI, this project leverages **Groq AI** to process user input and return AI-generated responses. The API is built with Express.js and deployed on **Render** using a Dockerfile.

# Tech Stack

- **Groq AI SDK** – Access GPT models hosted on Groq AI.
- **Express.js** – Web framework for defining API routes.
- **Docker** – Containerization for deployment.
- **Render** – Cloud platform for hosting the application.

# Setup Instructions
